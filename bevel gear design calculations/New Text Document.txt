    pinion diameter  =  110


  wrong : The number of teeth = 62.8571 (mm) and exm = 1.5
 It is over design , it shloud be integer number ....change the pinion diameter

 the nearst values to your pinion diameter is  ( 108.5  ,  110.25 )

    pinion diameter  =  110.25


 please try to enter the tooth width b (mm)

 but rememper that b shloud be between :
  10.5 mm  to 17.5 mm  --> for cast teeth
 17.5 mm  to 43.75 mm )  --> for machined teeth

        tooth width b (mm)    =  38
